# JSON File Manipulation

This repository contains a set of scripts to read and manipulate JSON files.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Code Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd your-repository/Code
   ```

3. **Run the Script:**

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

   This script reads a JSON file, multiplies the numbers by 2, adds a new property, and writes the modified data to another file.

4. **Check the Output:**

   - The modified data is written to the `Sample/output-data.json` file.

## File Structure

- **Code:** Contains the main script (`index.js`) and utility functions (`readFile.js`) for reading and writing JSON files.
- **Sample:** Contains the input JSON file (`sample_input_data.json`) and (`sample_output_data.json`) serves as the input and output directory for the data respectively.
