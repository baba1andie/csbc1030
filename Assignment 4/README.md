### Usage

1. Populate `users.json` file with user data in the provided format.

2. Start the server:

   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

3. Access the following endpoints:

- Get all users: `http://localhost:3000/users`
- Get a specific user by ID: `http://localhost:3000/users/:id`
  Replace `:id` with the desired user ID.

### Notes

- Adjust the `users.json` file with your own user data or modify the file structure as needed.
- Ensure the server is running and accessible on `localhost` on port `3000`.
