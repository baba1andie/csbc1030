# Assignment 4 
This project implements a simple ExpressJS application that retrieves users from a JSON file and exposes two routes:

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the project directory.

2. Install dependencies 
   ```bash
   npm init 
   npm install express fs
 
3. Run the application using the following command :

 ```bash
    npm start 
    
4. The application will start on port 3000. You can access the routes using:
    1. `GET /users`: Returns a list of all users.
    2. `GET /users/:id`: Returns a specific user based on their ID.
